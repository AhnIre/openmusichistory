A prominent instrumental composer contemporary with Henry Purcell was [Arcangelo Corelli](Arcangelo_Corelli.md) (1653–1713). While Purcell focused primarily on vocal and theatrical music, Corelli developed the genres of the trio sonata and concerto, helping to establish the formal structure of Baroque instrumental music.
