## Who is Elisabeth Jacquet De La Guerre?  

**Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre** (1665–1729) was a prominent *French* composer and harpsichordist during the Baroque era. She lived during the reign of *Louis XIV*, a period marked by flourishing artistic patronage and the dominance of French musical style. Recognized from an early age as a virtuoso performer, she was especially noted for her remarkable skill in harpsichord improvisation—an essential element of French musical practice at the time. As a composer, she was highly versatile, engaging with a wide range of genres that reflected the tastes and trends of late 17th- and early 18th-century France.

Initially, in the late 17th century, Jacquet de La Guerre contributed significantly to the development of **French harpsichord music**, working within the refined and ornamented style characteristic. Her early works embody the elegance and expressive subtlety of the French tradition.  
And she was especially known for composing **opera**, a field that had very few female composers in her era.
Despite the underwhelming reception of her opera *Céphale et Procris*, she did not cease composing. Instead, she continued to publish her works and steadily established her position in the musical world.



In the early 18th century, she also began to incorporate elements of the **Italian style**, reflecting the growing influence of composers such as [Arcangelo Corelli](A.Corelli.md)(1653-1713).
This stylistic fusion positioned her at the forefront of a broader cultural movement in France that sought to reconcile French and Italian musical aesthetics.

Through her innovative synthesis of national styles and her mastery of both composition and performance, Jacquet de La Guerre occupies an important place in the musical history of the Baroque period.

# 6 Violin Sonatas  
She published six violin sonatas in 1797, just three years after the appearance of the "Sonata" publication in France. These were released as a set, with the second book of harpsichord pieces included in the first half of the collection. The first half of the work is titled "Pieces for harpsichord that can be played on the violin" (Pièces de clavecin qui peuvent se jouer sur le viollon), while the latter half is titled "Sonatas for violin and for harpsichord" (Sonates pour le viollon et pour le clavecin). In his book Baroque Music, John Walter Hill suggested that the title of the first half implies "a single melodic line in the upper staff can be played by the violin (either doubling the harpsichord or as a solo), while the lower parts can be played on the keyboard."
그녀는 프랑스에서 출판물 소나타가 등장한지 3년 만에 6개의 바이올린 소나타를 출판(1797)하였는데, 전반부에 클라브생 곡집 제 2권을 포함시켜 한 세트로 출판하였다. 작품집의 전반부에는 “바이올린으로도 연주될 수 있 는 클라브생 곡집(pièces de clavecin qui peuvent se jouer sur le viollon)”이라는 제목이 달려 있으며, 후반부에는 “바이올린을 위한 그리고 클라브생을 위한 소나타(Sonates pour le viollon et pour le clavecin)”라는 제목이 붙어있다. 힐(John Walter Hill)은 그의 저서『Baroque Music(바로크 음악)』에서 전반부의 제목이 “상위 보표에 있는 하나의 선율 라인은 바이올린(하프시코드와 더블링하거나 또는 독주함)으로 연주 될 수 있으며, 반면 낮은 성부는 건반으로 연주 될 수 있음”을 의미한다고 보았다.  

At the turn of the 18th century, Italian instrumental music—particularly the sonata form—was gaining popularity in France, a nation traditionally focused on vocal and dance-based forms. Jacquet de La Guerre’s violin sonatas reflect this cultural shift. While the precise dates of composition are uncertain, the fact that composer and theorist Sébastien de Brossard copied some of her works as early as 1695 indicates their circulation and relevance by that time.

## What is a violin?
The violin is a string instrument with four strings, played by drawing a bow across the strings or by plucking them with the fingers.
Among string instruments, it has the highest pitch range, and its tone is clear and delicate.  
The violin plays a central role in orchestras, chamber music, and solo performances across a wide range of musical genres.  
During the Baroque era, violins used gut strings and a short, lightweight bow, producing an elegant and ornamented style of performance.
In the Classical period, improvements in the instrument's structure and bow design allowed for a more refined and balanced sound.
In the Romantic era, the violin became a powerful tool for emotional expression, with virtuosic techniques gaining prominence and the instrument's musical significance greatly expanding.
In the modern era, the use of metal strings, advanced bow construction, and electronic technology has further enhanced the violin’s volume and expressive capabilities.
Today, the violin is actively used not only in classical music but also in jazz, film scores, and many other musical styles.

## Listening Guide 
During the Baroque era, most musical pieces weren't strictly limited to the written score; performers often added improvised and free ornamentation. Let's listen to this piece, imagining those spontaneous embellishments.
바로크 시대에는 대부분의 곡이 악보에 제한되지 않고 연주자의 즉흥적이고 자유로운 꾸밈음에 의해 연주되었다. 자유로운 꾸밈음을 상상하며 들어보자.
