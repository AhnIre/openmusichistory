## About Elisabeth Jacquet De La Guerre
Born:17 March 1665 Paris, France   
Died:27 June 1729 Paris, France  
Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre (1665–1729) was a prominent French composer and harpsichordist during the Baroque era. Recognized from an early age as a virtuoso performer, she was especially noted for her remarkable skill in harpsichord improvisation—an essential element of French musical practice at the time. As a composer, she was highly versatile, engaging with a wide range of genres that reflected the tastes and trends of late 17th- and early 18th-century France.

Initially, in the late 17th century, Jacquet de La Guerre contributed significantly to the development of French harpsichord music, working within the refined and ornamented style characteristic of composers like [François Couperin](couperin_chaconne.md)(1668-1733). Her early works embody the elegance and expressive subtlety of the French tradition.

In the early 18th century, however, she also began to incorporate elements of the Italian style, reflecting the growing influence of composers such as [Arcangelo Corelli](A.Corelli.md)(1653-1713).
This stylistic fusion positioned her at the forefront of a broader cultural movement in France that sought to reconcile French and Italian musical aesthetics.

Through her innovative synthesis of national styles and her mastery of both composition and performance, Jacquet de La Guerre occupies an important place in the musical history of the Baroque period.

During this period, Italian instrumental music was gaining considerable popularity in Paris.

## Why Elisabeth Jacquet De La Guerre?
She possessed extensive learning and understanding of compositional techniques in a field that was limited for women at the time. Despite the poor reception of her operas, she continued to present her works and seize opportunities. The sonatas she composed later in life contributed to the development of the genre by advancing the role of the violin and blending French tradition with Italian innovation.
