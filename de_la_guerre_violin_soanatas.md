## About Elisabeth Jacquet De La Guerre
Élisabeth Jacquet de La Guerre (1665–1729) was a prominent French composer and harpsichordist during the Baroque era. She lived during the reign of Louis XIV, a period marked by flourishing artistic patronage and the dominance of French musical style. Recognized from an early age as a virtuoso performer, she was especially noted for her remarkable skill in harpsichord improvisation—an essential element of French musical practice at the time. As a composer, she was highly versatile, engaging with a wide range of genres that reflected the tastes and trends of late 17th- and early 18th-century France.

Initially, in the late 17th century, Jacquet de La Guerre contributed significantly to the development of French harpsichord music, working within the refined and ornamented style characteristic of composers like [François Couperin](couperin_chaconne.md)(1668-1733). Her early works embody the elegance and expressive subtlety of the French tradition.

In the early 18th century, however, she also began to incorporate elements of the Italian style, reflecting the growing influence of composers such as [Arcangelo Corelli](A.Corelli.md)(1653-1713).
This stylistic fusion positioned her at the forefront of a broader cultural movement in France that sought to reconcile French and Italian musical aesthetics.

Through her innovative synthesis of national styles and her mastery of both composition and performance, Jacquet de La Guerre occupies an important place in the musical history of the Baroque period.

## 6 Violin Sonatas
![score](./delaguerre_악보최종.png)
Among her most significant contributions are her Six Violin Sonatas, which were transmitted both in manuscript and printed form. The surviving manuscripts include two solo sonatas and four trio sonatas for two violins and basso continuo. Additionally, a published set of six sonatas for violin and basso continuo showcases her engagement with contemporary instrumental trends.

At the turn of the 18th century, Italian instrumental music—particularly the sonata form—was gaining popularity in France, a nation traditionally focused on vocal and dance-based forms. Jacquet de La Guerre’s violin sonatas reflect this cultural shift. While the precise dates of composition are uncertain, the fact that composer and theorist Sébastien de Brossard copied some of her works as early as 1695 indicates their circulation and relevance by that time.


  
## Why Elisabeth Jacquet De La Guerre?
In an era when women composers faced significant social and institutional barriers, Jacquet de La Guerre distinguished herself through her command of compositional technique and her resilience in a male-dominated field. Though her opera Cephale et Procris received a lukewarm reception, she continued to compose and publish throughout her life, seizing opportunities to present her work to both elite and public audiences.

Her later violin sonatas are particularly notable for their role in expanding the expressive possibilities of the instrument. These works synthesize the refined ornamentation and elegance of the French style with the dynamic energy and structure of Italian sonatas, contributing meaningfully to the development of instrumental music in France.
