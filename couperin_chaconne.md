Louis Couperin was a significant French Baroque composer, harpsichordist, and organist. He quickly became one of the most prominent Parisian musicians, establishing himself as a harpsichordist, organist, and violist, but his career was cut short by his early death at the age of thirty-five. In France, as in [Frescobaldi](frescobaldi_gagliarda.md) in Italy, Louis Couperin contributed greatly to keyboard music.

Born in Chaumes-en-Brie, he moved to Paris around 1650-1651 with the help of Jacques Champion de Chambonnières, a renowned harpsichordist. Couperin quickly established himself as a leading musician in Paris, serving as the organist of the Church of St. Gervais and as a musician at court.   

He made important contributions to both the French organ and harpsichord schools of composition. Notably, he composed organ pieces with specific instructions for registration (the selection of stops) and is credited with inventing the unmeasured prelude for the harpsichord. This unique genre featured a special notation style.

While his career was cut short by his early death at the age of thirty-five, Louis Couperin's music, particularly his harpsichord works characterized by intricate ornamentation and harmonic ingenuity, has had a lasting impact. His organ music is seen as a transition from strict counterpoint to a more colorful, concertante style, influencing later Baroque composers.

Although none of his music was published during his lifetime, a substantial amount of his work survives today, and he is highly regarded as one of the most important French keyboard composers of the 17th century.
