Louis Couperin (circa 1626–1661) was a highly influential French Baroque composer, harpsichordist, and organist. Emerging as a leading musical talent in Paris during the mid-17th century, he quickly secured a prominent reputation as a virtuosic performer on the harpsichord and organ, as well as a skilled viol player. His promising career, however, was tragically curtailed by his premature death at the age of thirty-five.

Born in Chaumes-en-Brie, Couperin's move to Paris around 1650–1651, with the crucial support of the renowned harpsichordist Jacques Champion de Chambonnières, marked a turning point in his life. He swiftly established himself within the vibrant Parisian musical scene, notably serving as the organist of the prestigious Church of St. Gervais and as a musician in the royal court.

Louis Couperin, much like [Frescobaldi](frescobaldi_gagliarda.md) in Italy, made significant and lasting contributions to the evolution of both French organ and harpsichord music. He played a key role in developing the French organ school, with compositions that included specific instructions for registration (the selection of organ stops), a novel practice at the time. Perhaps his most celebrated innovation was the development of the unmeasured prelude for the harpsichord. This unique genre, characterized by a distinctive, free-flowing notational style, allowed for expressive and improvisatory performances.

Although his life was short, Louis Couperin's musical legacy, particularly his harpsichord pieces distinguished by their sophisticated ornamentation and inventive harmonies, has endured. His organ music is recognized as a crucial link in the transition from strict, contrapuntal writing to a richer, more concertante style, thereby influencing later Baroque composers. While none of his compositions were published during his lifetime, a substantial collection of his works has been preserved through manuscripts, solidifying his esteemed position as one of the foremost French keyboard composers of the 17th century. He is often compared to his Italian contemporary, Girolamo Frescobaldi, for the significant advancements he brought to keyboard music in France.
