## Timeline
## Java Suite
Java Suite, originally named "Phonoramas: Tonal journeys for the Pianoforte", is one of the piano works composed by Godowsky, and it was published in 1925. This suite consists of 12 pieces portraying the Island of Java, Indonesia after he visited and stayed in Java for four weeks.

As said before, Godowsky was a world traveler, and he has traveled to many countries, including those in South America and Far-East (Asia). Although Godowsky was fascinated by the uniqueness and richness of the countries he visited, it was the island of Java that impressed him the most. 

His original plan was to “to make picturesque, characteristic and fanciful works based on folk tunes and dances of exotic countries: Java, Japan, China, India, Turkey and perhaps one Jewish and one Negro piece.” However, the scenic beauty and vibrant cultural atmosphere of the Island of Java inspired his creativty and and “the thought gradually matured in me to recreate my roaming experiences in a cycle of musical travelogues—tonal journeys—which I have named collectively “Phonoramas,” beginning with a series of twelve descriptive scenes in Java.”

In the preface of Java Suite score, Godowsky stated his inspirations of making this piece:
> The Island of Java, called ‘The Garden of the East,’ with a population of close to forty million, is the most densely inhabited island in the world. It has a tropical, luxuriant vegetation; marvelous scenery and picturesque inhabitants; huge volcanoes, active and extinct; majestic ruins and imposing monuments of many centuries past…It was, however, the native music of the Javanese, in the heart of Java, at Djokja and Solo that made the most profound impression on me.

Therefore, we can conclude that **JAVA IS KEY**

Out of the twelve pieces, eight are inspired from specific city, location, monument, or landmark (Sacred lake of Wendit, BoroBudur Temple, Mount Bromo, Buitenzorg Gardens, Old Batavia Streets, Kraton Djokja and Kraton Solo, Taman Sari Djokja, and the city of Solo), meanwhile the other four (Gamelan, Wayang Purwa, Hari Besaar, and Three Dances) reflect his general musical and cultural impressions throughout his journey.

The map of Java below highlights the major cities and locations featured in the Suite, with the numbers indicating the order of each movement in the composition.
