## Timeline
## Java Suite
Java Suite, originally named "Phonoramas: Tonal journeys for the Pianoforte", is one of the piano works composed by Godowsky, and it was published in 1925. This suite consists of 12 pieces portraying the Island of Java, Indonesia after he visited and stayed in Java for four weeks.

As said before, Godowsky was a world traveler, and he has traveled to many countries, including those in South America and Far-East (Asia). Although Godowsky was fascinated by the uniqueness and richness of the countries he visited, it was the island of Java that impressed him the most. 

His original plan was to “to make picturesque, characteristic and fanciful works based on folk tunes and dances of exotic countries: Java, Japan, China, India, Turkey and perhaps one Jewish and one Negro piece.” However, the scenic beauty and vibrant cultural atmosphere of the Island of Java inspired his creativty and and “the thought gradually matured in me to recreate my roaming experiences in a cycle of musical travelogues—tonal journeys—which I have named collectively “Phonoramas,” beginning with a series of twelve descriptive scenes in Java.”

In the preface of Java Suite score, Godowsky stated his inspirations of making this piece:
> The Island of Java, called ‘The Garden of the East,’ with a population of close to forty million, is the most densely inhabited island in the world. It has a tropical, luxuriant vegetation; marvelous scenery and picturesque inhabitants; huge volcanoes, active and extinct; majestic ruins and imposing monuments of many centuries past…It was, however, the native music of the Javanese, in the heart of Java, at Djokja and Solo that made the most profound impression on me.

Out of the twelve pieces, eight are inspired from specific city, location, monument, or landmark (Sacred lake of Wendit, BoroBudur Temple, Mount Bromo, Buitenzorg Gardens, Old Batavia Streets, Kraton Djokja and Kraton Solo, Taman Sari Djokja, and the city of Solo), meanwhile the other four (Gamelan, Wayang Purwa, Hari Besaar, and Three Dances) reflect his general musical and cultural impressions throughout his journey.

The map of Java below highlights the major cities and locations featured in the Suite, with the numbers indicating the order of each movement in the composition.

### I. Gamelan
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e0a5123-e9d3-451e-b40c-4361cf2f4b2a)

Gamelan is a traditional orchestra music of Java and Bali of Indonesia, consisting percussive instruments made of wood, bamboo, and metal, including numerous kinds and sizes of bells, chimes, gongs, sounding boards, bowls, pans, kendang (barrel-like drums), alang-alang (aeolian harp-like), and other unique instruments.

Godowsky's impression on gamelan is as follows:

> The sonority of the Gamelan is so weird, spectral, fantastic and bewitching, the native music so elusive, vague, shimmering and singular, that on listening to this new world of sound I lost my sense of reality, imagining myself in a realm of enchantment.

This opening movement is completely almost diatonic and mainly pentatonic with an oriental-sounding fair. The soft Moderato, languido opening appears as if inviting the listener to another world, a world of timelessness, while introducing the shimmering sonorities of gamelan, reimagined for piano. Not only imitating the sonority of gamelan, Godowsky also followed the typical structure of a gamelan piece, which begin softly and slowly, gradually increasing toward a dramatic climax, before calming down to a tranquil end.

### II. Wayang-Purwa, Puppet Shadow Plays

### V. Boro Budur in Moonlight

Borobudur is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple, located 35 miles away from Djokja. It is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, decorated with over 500 Buddha statues, standing firm on a sacred hill between two volcanoes. For centuries, this temple has attracted pilgrims and travelers, including Godowsky, who was captivated by the monumental scale of its vast ruins.

Godowsky was mainly thrilled by the temple's appearance in the evening:

> In moonlight, Boro Budur is most fantastic. An uncanny, eerie, melancholy mood permeates the whole atmosphere. Deep silence and a sense of strangeness and out-of-the-worldness contribute to the impression of utter desolation and to the feeling of inevitable decay and dissolution of all things earthly, the hopeless struggle of human endeavor against eternity.

The ambience of Borobudur under the serene glow of moonlight is transcribed into music with gently flowing melodies and luminous harmonies, with the tempo _Molto tranquillo, misterioso_. In creating a bell-like sonorities, Godowsky used broken octaves, with techniques similar to what Debussy used in _Et la Lune Descend sur le Temple qui Fut_.

### VI. The Bromo Volcano and the Sand Sea at Daybreak

(Shifting from the temple at moonlight to the mountain at dawn..) Mount Bromo is an active volcano located in East Java, reaching 2.329 meters high, and surrounded by a large sea of sand. The sunrise at this mountain never fails anyone to leave in wonder, including Godowsky, which stated:

> A marvelous sunrise enhanced the terrifying hugeness and transcendental grandeur of this awe-inspiring panorama. The boiling, roaring, rumbling subterranean forces, seething and spouting up from abysmal depths, the sulphurous vapors and dense clouds, spreading steadily and menacingly over the horizon, suggested scenes from Dante’s Inferno, and brought to realization the fact that cataclysmic activities, everlasting fires in the bowels of the earth, threaten all that is alive.

This movement opens in _grandioso_ mark, capturing the majesty of Mount Bromo. Godowsky used harmonic layering and triplet sweeping figures divided into two hands to thicken the texture and evoke the interplay of light and shadow over the volcanic terrain. Unlike other final movements, the climax in this final movement occurs in the middle, calming down towards the end, like a volcano cooling down after erupting.

### VII. Three Dances

### VIII. The Gardens of Buitenzorg
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2525db-84bf-4ba0-8873-83458483437a)

Buitenzorg (renamed to Bogor in 1942) is a city located 35 miles south of Jakarta, where the famous botanical gardens take place. The gardens consist of about 81 hectares and over 15.000 species of flowers, plants, and trees. In the middle of the garden was a palace where the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies lived and is now a presidential palace.

Godowsky loved to immerse himself in the vibrant tropical flora and gently winding pathways where he was fascinated by their aesthetic scents, and he described his feelings toward this experience:

> The heavily perfumed air awakens an inexpressibly deep and painful yearning for unknown worlds, for inaccessible ideals, for past happenings irrevocably gone- these memories which the ocean of time gradually submerges and finally buries in oblivion…Why do certain scents produce unutterable regrets, insatiable longings, indefinable desires?

In this movement, Godowsky's use of ornamental melodies and intense chromaticism to show the intoxicating fragrances and rich harmonic textures and subtle harmonic shifts to consider that our sense of smell is constantly being changed by numbers of stimuli around us. Therefore, unlike other movements in this suite that depict sounds and images, in this movement, Godowsky wanted to express his sense of smell of the flowers and plants in Buitenzorg Gardens to us.
