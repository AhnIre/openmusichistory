## Timeline
## Java Suite
Java Suite, originally named "Phonoramas: Tonal journeys for the Pianoforte", is one of the piano works composed by Godowsky, and it was published in 1925. This suite consists of 12 pieces portraying the Island of Java, Indonesia after he visited and stayed in Java for four weeks.

As said before, Godowsky was a world traveler, and he has traveled to many countries, including those in South America and Far-East (Asia). Although Godowsky was fascinated by the uniqueness and richness of the countries he visited, it was the island of Java that impressed him the most. 

His original plan was to “to make picturesque, characteristic and fanciful works based on folk tunes and dances of exotic countries: Java, Japan, China, India, Turkey and perhaps one Jewish and one Negro piece.” However, the scenic beauty and vibrant cultural atmosphere of the Island of Java inspired his creativty and and “the thought gradually matured in me to recreate my roaming experiences in a cycle of musical travelogues—tonal journeys—which I have named collectively “Phonoramas,” beginning with a series of twelve descriptive scenes in Java.”

In the preface of Java Suite score, Godowsky stated his inspirations of making this piece:
> The Island of Java, called ‘The Garden of the East,’ with a population of close to forty million, is the most densely inhabited island in the world. It has a tropical, luxuriant vegetation; marvelous scenery and picturesque inhabitants; huge volcanoes, active and extinct; majestic ruins and imposing monuments of many centuries past…It was, however, the native music of the Javanese, in the heart of Java, at Djokja and Solo that made the most profound impression on me.

Out of the twelve pieces, eight are inspired from specific city, location, monument, or landmark (Sacred lake of Wendit, BoroBudur Temple, Mount Bromo, Buitenzorg Gardens, Old Batavia Streets, Kraton Djokja and Kraton Solo, Taman Sari Djokja, and the city of Solo), meanwhile the other four (Gamelan, Wayang Purwa, Hari Besaar, and Three Dances) reflect his general musical and cultural impressions throughout his journey.

The map of Java below highlights the major cities and locations featured in the Suite, with the numbers indicating the order of each movement in the composition.

### I. Gamelan
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e0a5123-e9d3-451e-b40c-4361cf2f4b2a)

Gamelan is a traditional orchestra music of Java and Bali of Indonesia, consisting percussive instruments made of wood, bamboo, and metal, including numerous kinds and sizes of bells, chimes, gongs, sounding boards, bowls, pans, kendang (barrel-like drums), alang-alang (aeolian harp-like), and other unique instruments.

Godowsky's impression on gamelan is as follows:

> The sonority of the Gamelan is so weird, spectral, fantastic and bewitching, the native music so elusive, vague, shimmering and singular, that on listening to this new world of sound I lost my sense of reality, imagining myself in a realm of enchantment.

This opening movement is completely almost diatonic and mainly pentatonic with an oriental-sounding fair. The soft Moderato, languido opening appears as if inviting the listener to another world, a world of timelessness, while introducing the shimmering sonorities of gamelan, reimagined for piano. Not only imitating the sonority of gamelan, Godowsky also followed the typical structure of a gamelan piece, which begin softly and slowly, gradually increasing toward a dramatic climax, before calming down to a tranquil end.

### II. Wayang-Purwa, Puppet Shadow Plays

### IV. Chattering Monkeys at the Sacred Lake of Wendit
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22ae8a41-f1b4-4a9e-bfd8-47dc0e4936fd)

The Sacred Lake of Wendit is located in Mangliawan Village, several miles from the city of Malang, East Java. According to the local folklore, the lake was believed to hold mystical powers, granting eternal youth to those who bathed in its waters. On every side of the lake were numerous monkeys having fun and providing entertainment for the visitors, including Godowsky:

> On every side are jabbering monkeys, hundreds of them, jumping from tree to tree, running up and down the trunks and branches, while others, nearer the ground, are springing on and off the roofs of the small hotel and the bathhouses, snatching bananas from the visitors.
> The scene is full of humor, fun and animation.

This movement represents the mischievous energy of the monkeys through rapid, darting passages that evoke their chatter and lively antics. Godowsky used quick staccato notes and alternating repeated chords, sudden dynamic shifts, and syncopated rhythms to mirror their unpredictable movements and create an ambience filled with vitality and humor. The middle and end of the movement shows us calming moments, depicting the serene beauty of the lake and its sacred surroundings.

### V. Boro Budur in Moonlight
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0afa3264-48be-41b0-a2f0-eecc6e6b928b)

Borobudur is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple, located 35 miles away from Djokja. It is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, decorated with over 500 Buddha statues, standing firm on a sacred hill between two volcanoes. For centuries, this temple has attracted pilgrims and travelers, including Godowsky, who was captivated by the monumental scale of its vast ruins.

Godowsky was mainly thrilled by the temple's appearance in the evening:

> In moonlight, Boro Budur is most fantastic. An uncanny, eerie, melancholy mood permeates the whole atmosphere. Deep silence and a sense of strangeness and out-of-the-worldness contribute to the impression of utter desolation and to the feeling of inevitable decay and dissolution of all things earthly, the hopeless struggle of human endeavor against eternity.

The ambience of Borobudur under the serene glow of moonlight is transcribed into music with gently flowing melodies and luminous harmonies, with the tempo _Molto tranquillo, misterioso_. In creating a bell-like sonorities, Godowsky used broken octaves, with techniques similar to what Debussy used in _Et la Lune Descend sur le Temple qui Fut_.

### VI. The Bromo Volcano and the Sand Sea at Daybreak

(Shifting from the temple at moonlight to the mountain at dawn..) Mount Bromo is an active volcano located in East Java, reaching 2.329 meters high, and surrounded by a large sea of sand. The sunrise at this mountain never fails anyone to leave in wonder, including Godowsky, which stated:

> A marvelous sunrise enhanced the terrifying hugeness and transcendental grandeur of this awe-inspiring panorama. The boiling, roaring, rumbling subterranean forces, seething and spouting up from abysmal depths, the sulphurous vapors and dense clouds, spreading steadily and menacingly over the horizon, suggested scenes from Dante’s Inferno, and brought to realization the fact that cataclysmic activities, everlasting fires in the bowels of the earth, threaten all that is alive.

This movement opens in _grandioso_ mark, capturing the majesty of Mount Bromo. Godowsky used harmonic layering and triplet sweeping figures divided into two hands to thicken the texture and evoke the interplay of light and shadow over the volcanic terrain. Unlike other final movements, the climax in this final movement occurs in the middle, calming down towards the end, like a volcano cooling down after erupting.

### VII. Three Dances

### VIII. The Gardens of Buitenzorg
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2525db-84bf-4ba0-8873-83458483437a)

Buitenzorg (renamed to Bogor in 1942) is a city located 35 miles south of Jakarta, where the famous botanical gardens take place. The gardens consist of about 81 hectares and over 15.000 species of flowers, plants, and trees. In the middle of the garden was a palace where the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies lived and is now a presidential palace.

Godowsky loved to immerse himself in the vibrant tropical flora and gently winding pathways where he was fascinated by their aesthetic scents, and he described his feelings toward this experience:

> The heavily perfumed air awakens an inexpressibly deep and painful yearning for unknown worlds, for inaccessible ideals, for past happenings irrevocably gone- these memories which the ocean of time gradually submerges and finally buries in oblivion…Why do certain scents produce unutterable regrets, insatiable longings, indefinable desires?

In this movement, Godowsky's use of ornamental melodies and intense chromaticism to show the intoxicating fragrances and rich harmonic textures and subtle harmonic shifts to consider that our sense of smell is constantly being changed by numbers of stimuli around us. Therefore, unlike other movements in this suite that depict sounds and images, in this movement, Godowsky wanted to express his sense of smell of the flowers and plants in Buitenzorg Gardens to us.

### IX. In the Streets of Old Batavia
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de6de3f4-0bf4-49c8-b82c-550671348c6a)

Batavia (now named Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia) is a bustling, multicultural city characterized with its extensive network of water canals and the administrative center of Dutch East Indies. The small, old area of Batavia, located in the northern side of the city, are filled with busy bazaars, weathered european-inspired buildings, narrow streets, and people of different origins such as Indonesian natives, Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans.

This movement starts with quick sixteenth running notes in a pentatonic scale, depicting the vibrant ambience of the Chinese. Then, a section full of whole-tone scales begins as if one is wandering around, lost in the alley. The movement continues by portraying the Arabs with intricate, melismatic melodies in Dorian mode following an illustration of the Indonesian natives with melodious pentatonic air. The end of this movement is a bombastic climax, representing the busy, crowded bazaars. 

### X. In the Kraton
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a06cec9-e092-407f-965a-d370a8c2589b)

Surakarta (popularly called Solo) and Djokjakarta or Yogyakarta (commonly called Djokja or Yogya) are two of the most important cities in Java, historically. There were kingdoms which capital were located in both cities, and in the heart of a capital is a Kraton, a royal palace where the Sultans live, along with his princes and princesses, concubines, slaves and servants, court workers, musicians, and other individuals with numerous occupations. Each Kraton has about ten thousand until fifteen thousand inhabitants, making it a court of huge dimensions.

Similar with Boro Budur in Moonlight, Godowsky depicts the mystique atmosphere of the Kraton in the evening:

> Quaint scenes charm our vision. Faint sounds of the entrancing Gamelan fill the fragrant air. The seemingly unreal reality casts a hypnotic spell over our consciousness. There is poetry in every ebbing moment. It is evening in the Orient…

In this movement, Godowsky again explored numerous gamelan sonorities, with a soft and ethereal opening like in a typical gamelan piece, following the tension with various contrapuntal layers and complex polyrhytmic texture to explore the sounds of gong and bells that shake one's soul. This movement lets the listener to visualize the Kraton’s ornate architecture, quiet courtyards, and the distant hum of traditional music echoing through its halls, all while immersing in Godowsky’s deeply personal impressions of Javanese culture.

### XI. The Ruined Water Castle at Djokja
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bdab86b-5480-4e14-bea4-252018ed7af5)

The Water Castle refers to Taman Sari, built in the eighteenth century as the Sultan's summer palace near the Kraton of Djokja. It is surrounded by small canals and cascading waterfalls that flow over the walls gracefully. However, because of destructive events such as British invasion, Java war, and earthquake, the water castle was deserted in the end of 19th century.

The word "Taman" means "garden" and "Sari" means "beautiful" or "flower". Godowsky described the place as follows:

> deserted, fallen into decay, stand the mouldy and crumbling remains of the once resplendent Water Palace, with its murmuring fountains and splashing cascades, with its aquatic pranks and air-filling scents of exotic flowers.

Furthermore, Godowsky's reflection, inspired by East Asian philosophy, which establishes a connection between the movement of water and the path of life, is as follows:

> Where once was merriment, there is now the mystery and romance of vanished days, the sadness of evanescent pleasures.
> The fountains and cascades murmur memories of yesteryears—yearning for past joys, mourning for departed love….

In this movement, Godowsky was inspired by Ravel's Jeaux d'eau as both pieces represent the movement of water, shown in arpeggiated figurations. This movement begins with a meditative introduction that resembles the collapsed architecture and quiet mystery of the palace. Throughout the movement, Godowsky used modal harmonies and delicate textures to represent an exoticism tinged with nostalgia, along with flowing arpeggios and shimmering cascades of sound which imitates the gentle play of water. No moment of silence is found all through the movement, instead, Godowsky fused all moments together by uninterrupted sixteenth notes, symbolizing the continuous stream of water.

### XII. A Court Pageant in Solo
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d761bc5-ec6f-4bce-afad-f06cc336c5ef)

Although Godowsky did not specify a particular historical or cultural pageant in this movement, it is clear that this movement illustrates a royal court procession in Kraton Solo, a spectacular occassion, showcasing gamelan music, colorful costumes, lively dances, and exuberant celebrations. The procession evokes the deeply symbolic elements of court life. Dancers move with deliberate grace, their gestures narrating tales of mythology, spirituality, and historical events. Accompanied by the gentle yet intricate sounds of the gamelan orchestra, the performance immerses audiences in the distinctive rhythms and melodies of Javanese music. The costumes, adorned with intricate batik patterns and golden accessories, embody the craftsmanship and attention to detail for which Solo is renowned.

As the end of the suite, Godowsky used all the elements he has explored throughout the previous eleven movements: intricate imitations of gamelan sonorities, expansive dynamic range, persistent ostinato patterns, and excessively layered contrapuntal writing, making it the one of the most technically demanding movement in this suite, with a vivid and richly textured musical experience.

Godowsky gave us further description of the composition:

> The clanging and clashing march opens the event. Strongly emphasized in the middle section (F-sharp minor) of this closing composition is that strain of sadness ever present in the music of the Orient. The hilarious mood is resumed with the Fugato, which leads back to an intensified version of the barbaric march. And here these tonal journeys come to an end.
