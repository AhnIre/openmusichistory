# Leopold Godowsky (1870-1938)

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f127db3b-45cf-4c3a-ab2c-17a1af379a67)

Leopold Godowsky was a Lithuania-born American composer and virtuoso pianist, known for his extraordinary piano technique. As a performer, Godowsky could navigate the most challenging passages with remarkable effortlessness. Equally gifted as an improviser, his impromptu encores often left a more lasting impression than the pieces originally featured on his program. 

For most of the time of his career as a composer, Godowsky wrote music only for piano, except for some arrangements he made for strings and piano. He was heavily influenced by Chopin and Liszt. Inspired from Chopin, Godowsky really loved the piano's ability to produce a pure, singing tone and to offer endless opportunities to explore layered techniques and nuanced tonal colors---that's why he chose to explore those sounds in his beloved, instrument, piano, instead of writing music for orchestras or ensembles. Unlike Liszt who was the first to reproduce the vastness and intensity of symphonic orchestration into the piano, Godowsky translated the rich and dynamic orchestral sound to contrapuntal piano textures while preserving the sensitivity of pure piano sound and colors that can be found in Chopin's works, including his [second piano sonata](chopin-piano-sonata.md).

Not only a composer, Godowsky was also one of the most succesful concert pianists of his time. Starting at the young age, Godowsky had been keeping a busy schedule as a concert pianist (giving 107 concerts in 1891 within the US and Canada), including doing tours around the world to perform too, until 1930 when he suffered from stroke. He also left prominent remarks as a pedagogue, where developed the weight-release theory to release tension and to boost the most efficient 
method of playing the piano and became a piano teacher in the USA and Europe.

Last but not least, Godowsky was a world traveler. As described by Millan Sachania in her introductory essay to Godowsky complete original works:

> Godowsky considered travel not only a way of lifting the creative intellect, but also a philosophical, spiritual enterprise, a way of advancing one’s journey of self-discovery.

Besides his numerous concert tours in North America and Europe, his love of travelling took him to remote, “exotic” 
countries. Between 1921 and 1925, Godowsky went to Central and South American countries (Mexico, Uruguay, Argentina, and Brazil), East and Southeast Asia, as well as North Africa, Egypt and Palestine. Not only travelling, Godowsky also gave recitals in every country he visited.

## Java Suite
Java Suite, originally named "Phonoramas: Tonal journeys for the Pianoforte", is one of the piano works composed by Godowsky, and it was published in 1925. This suite consists of 12 pieces portraying the Island of Java, Indonesia after he visited, stayed, and gave not less than twenty piano recitals in Java for four weeks.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/592491f1-30b4-431d-b558-0323a4818b8f)

Illustration of Godowsky visiting Java Island

As described before, Godowsky was a world traveler. By travelling, Godowsky also stated that his original plan was to “to make picturesque, characteristic and fanciful works based on folk tunes and dances of exotic countries: Java, Japan, China, India, Turkey and perhaps one Jewish and one Negro piece.” However, it was the island of Java that impressed him the most, despite the fact that he was fascinated by the uniqueness and richness of the countries he visited. The scenic beauty and vibrant cultural atmosphere of the Island of Java inspired his creativty and and “the thought gradually matured in me to recreate my roaming experiences in a cycle of musical travelogues—tonal journeys—which I have named collectively “Phonoramas,” beginning with a series of twelve descriptive scenes in Java.”

In the preface of Java Suite score, Godowsky stated his inspirations of making this piece:
> The Island of Java, called ‘The Garden of the East,’ with a population of close to forty million, is the most densely inhabited island in the world. It has a tropical, luxuriant vegetation; marvelous scenery and picturesque inhabitants; huge volcanoes, active and extinct; majestic ruins and imposing monuments of many centuries past…It was, however, the native music of the Javanese, in the heart of Java, at Djokja and Solo that made the most profound impression on me.

Out of the twelve pieces, eight are inspired from specific city, location, monument, or landmark (Sacred lake of Wendit, BoroBudur Temple, Mount Bromo, Buitenzorg Gardens, Old Batavia Streets, Kraton Djokja and Kraton Solo, Taman Sari Djokja, and the city of Solo), meanwhile the other four (Gamelan, Wayang Purwa, Hari Besaar, and Three Dances) reflect his general musical and cultural impressions throughout his journey. Those pieces are also divided into four parts, resembling Albeniz's Iberia, with festive closing pieces in the end of each part.

The map of Java below highlights the major cities and locations featured in the Suite, with the numbers indicating the order of each movement in the composition.

### **PART I**
### I. Gamelan
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7e0a5123-e9d3-451e-b40c-4361cf2f4b2a)

Gamelan is a traditional orchestra music of Java and Bali of Indonesia, consisting percussive instruments made of wood, bamboo, and metal, including numerous kinds and sizes of bells, chimes, gongs, sounding boards, bowls, pans, kendang (barrel-like drums), alang-alang (aeolian harp-like), and other unique instruments.

Godowsky's impression on gamelan is as follows:

> The sonority of the Gamelan is so weird, spectral, fantastic and bewitching, the native music so elusive, vague, shimmering and singular, that on listening to this new world of sound I lost my sense of reality, imagining myself in a realm of enchantment.

This opening movement is completely almost diatonic and mainly pentatonic with an oriental-sounding fair. The soft Moderato, languido opening appears as if inviting the listener to another world, a world of timelessness, while introducing the shimmering sonorities of gamelan, reimagined for piano. Not only imitating the sonority of gamelan, Godowsky also followed the typical structure of a gamelan piece, which begin softly and slowly, gradually increasing toward a dramatic climax, before calming down to a tranquil end.

### II. Wayang-Purwa, Puppet Shadow Plays
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bb66a32b-2f7e-4f63-bf40-fd660e501339)

_Wayang-Purwa_, or _Wayang Kulit_, is a traditional javanese theatre show of shadow puppets (_wayang_ means shadow or imagination), using specific puppets as shown in the photo above. The stories of these shows are often derived from classic Hindu stories, mystical tales, and Eastern Indian Legends, and are recited by a puppet master (_Dalang_) while holding those puppets. Also, the performance is accompanied by gamelan music.

This movement evokes the dimly lit stage where the leather puppets cast moving shadows against a white screen, creating a black-and-white simplicity. Godowsky used a narrative manner to draw the listeners to an imaginary world and simple melodious tune (ascending and descending diatonic scales) to induce the sense of storytelling. Godowsky's use of piano’s full range—soft, shimmering high notes paired with deep, resonant bass tones—creates a sonic depiction of the mysterious and otherworldly atmosphere of the wayang theater. Intricate textures and rhythmic motifs are also used to represent the interaction between the puppets and the rhythmic pulse of the gamelan music accompaniment. Lastly, the themes in this movement shift between reflective and dynamic, much like the alternating tension and resolution in the stories of heroes, gods, and demons.


### III. Hari Besaar, The Great Day
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/db646f5f-7de4-4816-b4a3-2d9e7d89409a)

Hari Besar, or The Great Day, is when the people are celebrating holiday by creating a joyous and bright festival. Godowsky stated his impression on this event as follows:

> From plantations and hamlets natives flock to the town that is the center of the bright, joyous celebrations, naive, harmless amusements. They throw themselves eagerly into the whirl of festivities, enjoying the excitement and animation.

In this movement, Godowsky took inspirations from Seelig's Javanese Rhapsody for orchestra for the opening theme and two authentic Javanese tunes: Krawita and Kanjut, as main themes.

![Theme of Javanese Rhapsody for Orchestra-1](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9b91b73-fc30-41cf-9f2c-938b0cf27a07)

Kanjut

![hari besar kanjut](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e42fc285-c507-4bb4-8260-fbac25f065b6)

Use of Kanjut in Hari Besar, m. 20-21

Godowsky's use of pentatonic scale and ostinato patterns represents the sonority of gamelan pointed out by gongs. Not only that, the ostinato patterns in the left hand also suggest continuous motion and movement of people and things in the festival, meanwhile the right hand depicts sparkling themes that rise and fall like fireworks in the night sky. 

The two Javanese tunes mentioned above, Kanjut and Krawita, continue to repeat again and again in various settings, resulting in a "festival" atmosphere. As this movement continues, the texture becomes thicker and more contrapuntal, and the repetitive motions build up tension until they finally burst to a majestic closing of the first part of the suite, reflecting the communal joy of the occasion and the profound cultural significance of the festival in Javanese life.

### **PART II**
### IV. Chattering Monkeys at the Sacred Lake of Wendit
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22ae8a41-f1b4-4a9e-bfd8-47dc0e4936fd)

The Sacred Lake of Wendit is located in Mangliawan Village, several miles from the city of Malang, East Java. According to the local folklore, the lake was believed to hold mystical powers, granting eternal youth to those who bathed in its waters. On every side of the lake were numerous monkeys having fun and providing entertainment for the visitors, including Godowsky:

> On every side are jabbering monkeys, hundreds of them, jumping from tree to tree, running up and down the trunks and branches, while others, nearer the ground, are springing on and off the roofs of the small hotel and the bathhouses, snatching bananas from the visitors.
> The scene is full of humor, fun and animation.

This movement represents the mischievous energy of the monkeys through rapid, darting passages that evoke their chatter and lively antics. Godowsky used quick staccato notes and alternating repeated chords, sudden dynamic shifts, and syncopated rhythms to mirror their unpredictable movements and create an ambience filled with vitality and humor. The middle and end of the movement shows us calming moments, depicting the serene beauty of the lake and its sacred surroundings.

### V. Boro Budur in Moonlight
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0afa3264-48be-41b0-a2f0-eecc6e6b928b)

Borobudur is a 9th-century Mahayana Buddhist temple, located 35 miles away from Djokja. It is the largest Buddhist temple in the world, decorated with over 500 Buddha statues, standing firm on a sacred hill between two volcanoes. For centuries, this temple has attracted pilgrims and travelers, including Godowsky, who was captivated by the monumental scale of its vast ruins.

Godowsky was mainly thrilled by the temple's appearance in the evening:

> In moonlight, Boro Budur is most fantastic. An uncanny, eerie, melancholy mood permeates the whole atmosphere. Deep silence and a sense of strangeness and out-of-the-worldness contribute to the impression of utter desolation and to the feeling of inevitable decay and dissolution of all things earthly, the hopeless struggle of human endeavor against eternity.

The ambience of Borobudur under the serene glow of moonlight is transcribed into music with gently flowing melodies and luminous harmonies, with the tempo _Molto tranquillo, misterioso_. In creating a bell-like sonorities, Godowsky used broken octaves, with techniques similar to what Debussy used in _Et la Lune Descend sur le Temple qui Fut_.

### VI. The Bromo Volcano and the Sand Sea at Daybreak
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b62c2514-a13f-4c62-8476-b7428fa766fe)

Mount Bromo is an active volcano located in East Java, reaching 2.329 meters high, and surrounded by a large sea of sand. The sunrise at this mountain never fails anyone to leave in wonder, including Godowsky, which stated:

> A marvelous sunrise enhanced the terrifying hugeness and transcendental grandeur of this awe-inspiring panorama. The boiling, roaring, rumbling subterranean forces, seething and spouting up from abysmal depths, the sulphurous vapors and dense clouds, spreading steadily and menacingly over the horizon, suggested scenes from Dante’s Inferno, and brought to realization the fact that cataclysmic activities, everlasting fires in the bowels of the earth, threaten all that is alive.

This movement opens in _grandioso_ mark, capturing the majesty of Mount Bromo. Godowsky used harmonic layering and triplet sweeping figures divided into two hands to thicken the texture and evoke the interplay of light and shadow over the volcanic terrain. Unlike other final movements, the climax in this final movement occurs in the middle, calming down towards the end, like a volcano cooling down after erupting.

### **PART III**
### VII. Three Dances
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3d73a47-3c61-4fc1-8201-e960cc6c42f2)

Historically, Javanese dances have been deeply rooted in religious and spiritual traditions. Many of these dances were performed as offerings to deities or as part of rituals in Javanese Hindu-Buddhist temples, symbolizing a connection between the human and the divine. This sacred setting is reflected in their tangled gestures, slow movements, and deep symbolism, which often represent cosmic harmony, myths, or moral teachings.

As the time goes by, secular dances was developed, often tied to the Kingdom of Djokja and Solo, where they evolved into a refined art form expressing emotions and social narratives. These dances maintained a spiritual depth even in secular settings, as they emphasized inner tranquility and profound storytelling through movement. That's why Godowsky stated as follows:

> It is doubtful if there is a people in any part of the world whose innermost feelings are so wholly revealed in their dances as are the Javanese.

The first dance depicts the ceremonial nature of calm and melancholic courtly dances, with the melodious and deliberate phrasings to represent the intricate movements of the dancers. The second dance is livelier than the first one, with syncopated rhythms and luminous harmonies to illustrate the joy and spontaneity of the village dances. Contrasting with the first two dances, the third dance explodes with energy and intricacy, with rapid notes, layered textures, and dynamic variations. It evokes the celebratory climax of a festival, where dancers’ intricate footwork and dramatic gestures reach a thrilling intensity.

### VIII. The Gardens of Buitenzorg
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad2525db-84bf-4ba0-8873-83458483437a)

Buitenzorg (renamed to Bogor in 1942) is a city located 35 miles south of Jakarta, where the famous botanical gardens take place. The gardens consist of about 81 hectares and over 15.000 species of flowers, plants, and trees. In the middle of the garden was a palace where the Governor-General of the Dutch East Indies lived and is now a presidential palace.

Godowsky loved to immerse himself in the vibrant tropical flora and gently winding pathways where he was fascinated by their aesthetic scents, and he described his feelings toward this experience:

> The heavily perfumed air awakens an inexpressibly deep and painful yearning for unknown worlds, for inaccessible ideals, for past happenings irrevocably gone- these memories which the ocean of time gradually submerges and finally buries in oblivion…Why do certain scents produce unutterable regrets, insatiable longings, indefinable desires?

In this movement, Godowsky's use of ornamental melodies and intense chromaticism to show the intoxicating fragrances and rich harmonic textures and subtle harmonic shifts to consider that our sense of smell is constantly being changed by numbers of stimuli around us. Therefore, unlike other movements in this suite that depict sounds and images, in this movement, Godowsky wanted to express his sense of smell of the flowers and plants in Buitenzorg Gardens to us.

### IX. In the Streets of Old Batavia
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de6de3f4-0bf4-49c8-b82c-550671348c6a)

Batavia (now named Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia) is a bustling, multicultural city characterized with its extensive network of water canals and the administrative center of Dutch East Indies. The small, old area of Batavia, located in the northern side of the city, are filled with busy bazaars, weathered european-inspired buildings, narrow streets, and people of different origins such as Indonesian natives, Chinese, Arabs, and Europeans.

This movement starts with quick sixteenth running notes in a pentatonic scale, depicting the vibrant ambience of the Chinese. Then, a section full of whole-tone scales begins as if one is wandering around, lost in the alley. The movement continues by portraying the Arabs with intricate, melismatic melodies in Dorian mode following an illustration of the Indonesian natives with melodious pentatonic air. The end of this movement is a bombastic climax, representing the busy, crowded bazaars. 

### **PART IV**
### X. In the Kraton
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a06cec9-e092-407f-965a-d370a8c2589b)

Surakarta (popularly called Solo) and Djokjakarta or Yogyakarta (commonly called Djokja or Yogya) are two of the most important cities in Java, historically. There were kingdoms which capital were located in both cities, and in the heart of a capital is a Kraton, a royal palace where the Sultans live, along with his princes and princesses, concubines, slaves and servants, court workers, musicians, and other individuals with numerous occupations. Each Kraton has about ten thousand until fifteen thousand inhabitants, making it a court of huge dimensions.

Similar with Boro Budur in Moonlight, Godowsky depicts the mystique atmosphere of the Kraton in the evening:

> Quaint scenes charm our vision. Faint sounds of the entrancing Gamelan fill the fragrant air. The seemingly unreal reality casts a hypnotic spell over our consciousness. There is poetry in every ebbing moment. It is evening in the Orient…

In this movement, Godowsky again explored numerous gamelan sonorities, with a soft and ethereal opening like in a typical gamelan piece, following the tension with various contrapuntal layers and complex polyrhytmic texture to explore the sounds of gong and bells that shake one's soul. This movement lets the listener to visualize the Kraton’s ornate architecture, quiet courtyards, and the distant hum of traditional music echoing through its halls, all while immersing in Godowsky’s deeply personal impressions of Javanese culture.

### XI. The Ruined Water Castle at Djokja
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1bdab86b-5480-4e14-bea4-252018ed7af5)

The Water Castle refers to Taman Sari, built in the eighteenth century as the Sultan's summer palace near the Kraton of Djokja. It is surrounded by small canals and cascading waterfalls that flow over the walls gracefully. However, because of destructive events such as British invasion, Java war, and earthquake, the water castle was deserted in the end of 19th century.

The word "Taman" means "garden" and "Sari" means "beautiful" or "flower". Godowsky described the place as follows:

> deserted, fallen into decay, stand the mouldy and crumbling remains of the once resplendent Water Palace, with its murmuring fountains and splashing cascades, with its aquatic pranks and air-filling scents of exotic flowers.

Furthermore, Godowsky's reflection, inspired by East Asian philosophy, which establishes a connection between the movement of water and the path of life, is as follows:

> Where once was merriment, there is now the mystery and romance of vanished days, the sadness of evanescent pleasures.
> The fountains and cascades murmur memories of yesteryears—yearning for past joys, mourning for departed love….

In this movement, Godowsky was inspired by Ravel's Jeaux d'eau as both pieces represent the movement of water, shown in arpeggiated figurations. This movement begins with a meditative introduction that resembles the collapsed architecture and quiet mystery of the palace. Throughout the movement, Godowsky used modal harmonies and delicate textures to represent an exoticism tinged with nostalgia, along with flowing arpeggios and shimmering cascades of sound which imitates the gentle play of water. No moment of silence is found all through the movement, instead, Godowsky fused all moments together by uninterrupted sixteenth notes, symbolizing the continuous stream of water.

### XII. A Court Pageant in Solo
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d761bc5-ec6f-4bce-afad-f06cc336c5ef)

Although Godowsky did not specify a particular historical or cultural pageant in this movement, it is clear that this movement illustrates a royal court procession in Kraton Solo, a spectacular occassion, showcasing gamelan music, colorful costumes, lively dances, and exuberant celebrations. The procession evokes the deeply symbolic elements of court life. Dancers move with deliberate grace, their gestures narrating tales of mythology, spirituality, and historical events. Accompanied by the gentle yet intricate sounds of the gamelan orchestra, the performance immerses audiences in the distinctive rhythms and melodies of Javanese music. The costumes, adorned with intricate batik patterns and golden accessories, embody the craftsmanship and attention to detail for which Solo is renowned.

As the end of the suite, Godowsky used all the elements he has explored throughout the previous eleven movements: intricate imitations of gamelan sonorities, expansive dynamic range, persistent ostinato patterns, and excessively layered contrapuntal writing, making it the one of the most technically demanding movement in this suite, with a vivid and richly textured musical experience.

Godowsky gave us further description of the composition:

> The clanging and clashing march opens the event. Strongly emphasized in the middle section (F-sharp minor) of this closing composition is that strain of sadness ever present in the music of the Orient. The hilarious mood is resumed with the Fugato, which leads back to an intensified version of the barbaric march. And here these tonal journeys come to an end.

## Influences

Godowsky was heavily influenced by Javanese music, especially gamelan, which is characterized by layered textures and voices, complex rhythms, and shimmering sounds. Although he did not transcribe gamelan music literally, his suite catches its spirit through rhythmic intricacy, pentatonic scales, and bell-like sonorities.

Not only influenced by gamelan music, Godowsky also integrated it with the virtuoso piano tradition of Liszt and Chopin and expanded the expressive techniques of the piano. His approach inspired later composers like Olivier Messiaen and Béla Bartók, who similarly took inspiration from non-Western music.

Lastly, Java Suite contributed to a growing interest in programmatic music works that illustrated exotic scene or tradition, which influenced later composers to explore non-European music.

## Significance

A Rare Example of Cultural Fusion: It is one of the first major Western classical works inspired by Southeast Asian music, reflecting Godowsky’s forward-thinking embrace of global musical traditions.

Technical and Artistic Innovation: The suite challenges the pianist with its intricate textures, demanding finger independence, and use of overlapping rhythms that evoke the multi-layered sound of the gamelan. These innovations expanded the expressive vocabulary of the piano.

Narrative and Imagery: Each movement of the suite is a tone poem, vividly painting scenes of Javanese life and landscapes, from the bustling streets of a city to serene temples and volcanic eruptions. This cinematic quality makes it a standout in the genre of programmatic piano music.

Cross-Cultural Representation: In a time when Western classical music often exoticized other cultures, Godowsky’s work stands out for its genuine admiration and respect for Javanese traditions, even if viewed through a Western lens.

## Performance and Reception

Java Suite is rarely performed as a whole because of the demands of technique and interpretation of the suite. Each of the 12 movements needs the pianist to master contrapuntal playing, complex textures, and bring the scenery to the listeners. However, single movements of this suite are more often performed separately from the suite. Pianists such as Marc-André Hamelin, Carlo Grante, and Esther Budiarjo have performed the suite over the past few years, introducing it to wider listeners and focusing its place as a virtuosic, passionate, and dramatic work.

This suite received mixed reviews from audiences and critics when first published in 1925. Some admired the technical brilliance, cross-cultural reference, and originality of the idea (not many composers had been inspired from Indonesian Culture in composing music at that time), while others refused it as an overly ornate or complex piece. However, in the recent times, Java Suite has been celebrated for its groundbreaking combination of Western pianistic techniques and Javanese music elegance, ahead of its time in exploring cross-cultural musical conversation.

## Listening Guide

In order to listen and understand this suite deeply, here are some things that listeners can do.

Firstly, we need to understand that Leopold Godowsky was one of technically expert pianists of his time, and he often wrote virtuosic pieces and wanted to see every technique that can be done in playing the piano. Inspired by Java Island in Dutch East Indies (now called Indonesia), Godowsky wrote the Java Suite in the 1920s, consisting of twelve movements, with each movement represents the different aspects of Javanese culture, scenery, and traditions.

Secondly, after knowing the title of a certain movement, listeners can do a little bit of research (or read previous sections of this text) to understand what that movement is about. Then, listeners can listen to the music while considering two things that Godowsky applied in the entire suite: Gamelan and Tone Painting. Gamelan music is characterized by complex rhythms, overlapping melodic lines, and pentatonic scales. Tone Painting means that the music really reflects what the composer wants to tell us, and listeners can imagine the scenery or cultural traditions in each movement while listening to the music.

Last but not least, listeners can do active listening, that is, to listen careully to the interaction between melody and accompaniment, to the sonorities of gamelan, to layers and contrapuntal elements, and other things. Listening to traditional Javanese gamelan music is also highly encouraged to appreciate Godowsky's interpretation better.
