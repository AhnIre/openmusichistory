# Domenico Scarlatti (1685~1757)

Italian Composer
**Domenico Scarlatti** was one of the most original composers of the 18th century, best known for his virtuosic keyboard sonatas. Born in **Naples** in 1685—the same year as Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel—Scarlatti was part of a generation that stood at the threshold **between the Baroque and Classical eras**.

He was the **son of [Alessandro Scarlatti](scarlatti_alessandro_gia_il_sole.md) (1660–1725)**, a major figure in Baroque music and one of the founders of the Neapolitan school of opera. Alessandro was instrumental in shaping the Italian opera overture and the cantata form, leaving a lasting legacy in vocal music.

Unlike his father, Domenico devoted much of his career to **instrumental music**, particularly works for the **harpsichord**. His keyboard compositions reflected the stylistic transformation of his time and helped to define the evolving aesthetic of the **early Classical style**.
