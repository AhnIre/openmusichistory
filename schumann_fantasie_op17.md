**Robert Schumann** (1810-1856) is one of the most significant composers in the history of Western classical music. He is known for his piano works, orchestral compositions, and chamber music, often blending lyrical expression with innovative harmonic structures. Also, Schumann often used descriptive titles related to literary ideas and thanks to the advanced piano techniques, sought effective sound and tone by employing a wide range of pedaling. Moreover, as Schumann was a pianist, he had a deep understanding of the piano's capabilities and expanded the role of the left hand, thereby extending its range.

## Fantasie in C Major Op.17

In 1836, the year "Fantasie in C Major Op.17" was composed during a time of personal and emotional turmoil in Schumann’s life, particularly influenced by his love for the pianist Clara Wieck. At the time, Clara's father, Friedrich Wieck, strongly opposed their relationship, which created significant tension and emotional strain for Schumann. This work was originally intended to be dedicated to Clara Wieck, but due to opposition from the Leipzig publisher Kistner, the movement titles were removed, and it was ultimately dedicated to Franz Liszt.


## Movement Breakdown

**I.Durchaus phantastisch und leidenschaftlich vorzutragen**

The first movement opens with a somber, introspective theme, marked by a deep sense of longing and emotional restraint. Schumann instructs the pianist to play "inflexibly," which indicates a rigid, almost mournful character. The movement features long, lyrical lines and expansive chords that convey a sense of both yearning and reverence.

*This piece is the most passionate movement of the music I have composed. This movement is a song of deep sorrow for you. -R.Schmann* 

The fact that Schumann himself said this highlights that the first movement should be played with great passion. Also instead of removing the movement titles, a poem by Schlegel was included at the beginning.

*Durch alle Töne tönet*

*Im bnnteu Erdentranm*

*Ein leiser Ton gezogeu*

*Für den der heimlieh lansehet*

Additionally, in the coda of this movement, Schumann expresses his reverence for Beethoven by quoting the melody from the final song of Beethoven's An die ferne Geliebte.

**II.Mässig. Durchaus energisch**

The second movement begins with a march-like rhythm. However, it should not be played in a fanfare-like manner; instead, it should convey a sense of pure devotion and the smile of hope directed towards Clara. Also the movement, originally conceived by Schumann with the title "Arc de Triomphe," perfectly matches this theme, with energetic harmonies forming the central motif.

**III.Langsam getragen. Durchweg leise zu halten**

The third movement, as Schumann wrote "ecstatically with joy," depicts the overflowing joy and sweet rest of one who has triumphed in battle. The introduction begins with arpeggios, followed by the quiet C major first theme. While the first theme is played, Schumann's favorite "Clara motif" is heard in the left hand. In this movement, Schumann also pays homage to Beethoven, incorporating the rhythmic form of the second movement of Beethoven's Symphony No. 7 as a tribute to Beethoven's influence.

This program note offers listeners a deeper understanding of the musical structure, emotional depth, and historical context of Schumann Fantasie in C Major Op.17, enhancing the listening experience and helping them connect with the piece on a more profound level.
