## Piano Sonata No.21 "Waldstein"
Beethoven's Sonata "Waldstein" shows innovation and originality in the sonata form, making it suitable for discussing Beethoven's musical development. And the way he effectively communicates emotions through contrasting themes provides a rich discussion of musical interpretation. Because of these factors, "Waldstein" is a highly interesting and educational value for presentation topics.Also, it was my college entrance song and I've been studying this song for a long time, so I think it's perfect for selecting this work.
