Beethoven is one of the most influential composers in classical music. Although Beethoven lived in classical era, especially when he was young, he did not follow any specific schools, guilds, or circles of composers that would influence his works, instead, he was courageous to explore and create music that was new and different.

Beethoven has set groundbreaking innovations in composing music. First, he broke the boundaries of classical era music that emphasizes clarity, lightness, and beauty, by composing darker, deeper, and sublime music. By doing this, he allowed his emotions and personal expressions to be in music. Second, he also explored new ways of playing music, such as making more virtuosic compositions that require more virtuosic and technical skill from performers. Third, he experimented with symphonic forms, leading him to compose his ninth symphony, the first-ever symphony not only performed by an orchestra but also by a choir. Therefore, it is not too much to say that Beethoven is the gate of romanticism, where he allowed later musicians to express their feelings in music and explore new harmonization and formation in composing music.

## Piano Concerto No. 5, Op. 73
Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5, Op.73 is one of the most popular works that he ever composed. This piece is composed between 1809 and 1811, in his middle period, where he went beyond classicism and started to explore his individual style of writing music –including writing with bolder tone, larger range of notes, and longer length of music– which would lead him to the romanticism. 

Unlike other piano concertos in the classical era and the first four of Beethoven’s piano concertos, Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5 begins with a piano cadenza (a written cadenza, specifically) that is interrupted by the orchestra which plays a long chord before the piano cadenza continues. Here, Beethoven did two things that had never been done before: beginning a piano concerto with a cadenza; and writing a written (and unfree) cadenza that prevents the performers from improvising the cadenza. 

Usually, in classical era piano concertos, the orchestra always directly begins the piece with an exposition part, typically two to three minutes long, which will be replayed by the piano (that’s why it’s called double exposition). However, in Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5, the orchestra played a chord, followed by a piano cadenza which will be followed by the orchestra playing a chord again, and followed by a piano cadenza again, and this will happen one more time before the orchestra plays the exposition part.

Cadenzas in other classical era piano concertos are usually played only once in the first movement, before the coda, and the cadenzas are typically long so that the performers have a lot of time to show their skills and they can also improvise if they want. However, in Beethoven’s 5th Piano Concerto the 1st movement, the cadenza is not long compared to typical cadenzas, and it is interrupted by the orchestra. For example, the first movement begins with the orchestra playing a long tonic chord, long subdominant chord, long dominant chord, and then the exposition, with piano cadenzas in between. This shows us that the cadenzas cannot be played freely and improvised because they need to resolve into those chords. If the performer improvises, the cadenzas are unlikely to resolve to the next written chords in the score, and if the cadenzas are too long, they will have no direction to the next chords. That’s why Beethoven wanted the cadenza to be short and precise.

Still talking about cadenza, in the first movement of this concerto, there are three places in which the cadenzas are played: the beginning, before the recapitulation, and before the coda. The characteristics of the cadenzas are the same: short and need to be played as written. This makes the concerto different compared to other classical piano concertos, where there is a long cadenza before the coda and performers can improvise it. 

Based on what Beethoven did in his 5th piano concerto, we can connect this with the phenomenon that classical musicians now are not able to improvise classical music scores, and this began with Beethoven. Before Beethoven, musicians were able to improvise based on minimal information written by the composers in the score. However, Beethoven did not agree with the idea of improvisation, and instead, he started writing a lot of specified dynamic markings, articulations, and tempo marking in his works, and he wanted the performers to play exactly as it was written. It also goes the same with his cadenzas, especially in his fifth piano concerto, where the performers can’t change the notes he has written. This is called the sacralization of the music scores, and this tradition caused the composers who lived after Beethoven to do the same thing as Beethoven did and it caused the performers not to improvise, but instead interpret the music scores and play it exactly as written.

Another important thing about this piano concerto other than the cadenza is the integration of the piano part and the orchestra part which is rarely used in other piano concertos in the classical era. In this concerto, Beethoven does not only make the piano part to play the melody but also plays the accompaniment part for the orchestra which plays the melody. In other words, the piano and orchestral parts collaborate in playing the melody together, not competing. Below is one of the examples of when the piano accompanies the orchestra (specifically, the horn part).

Although C.P.E Bach, J.C. Bach, Haydn, and Mozart have experimented with this composition technique of piano accompanying the orchestra, they still emphasize the piano part as the soloist. It is Beethoven who really used this technique in his composition, especially his fifth piano concerto, this would also influence later composers, such as Chopin, Brahms, Grieg, and Rachmaninoff.
