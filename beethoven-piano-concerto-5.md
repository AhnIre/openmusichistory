Beethoven is one of the most influential composers in classical music. Although Beethoven lived in classical era, especially when he was young, he did not follow any specific schools, guilds, or circles of composers that would influence his works, instead, he was courageous to explore and create music that was new and different.

Beethoven has set groundbreaking innovations in composing music. First, he broke the boundaries of classical era music that emphasizes clarity, lightness, and beauty, by composing darker, deeper, and sublime music. By doing this, he allowed his emotions and personal expressions to be in music. Second, he also explored new ways of playing music, such as making more virtuosic compositions that require more virtuosic and technical skill from performers. Third, he experimented with symphonic forms, leading him to compose his ninth symphony, the first-ever symphony not only performed by an orchestra but also by a choir. Therefore, it is not too much to say that Beethoven is the gate of romanticism, where he allowed later musicians to express their feelings in music and explore new harmonization and formation in composing music.

## Piano Concerto No. 5, Op. 73
Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5, Op.73 is one of the most popular works that he ever composed. This piece is composed between 1809 and 1811, in his middle period, where he went beyond classicism and started to explore his individual style of writing music –including writing with bolder tone, larger range of notes, and longer length of music– which would lead him to the romanticism. 

Unlike other piano concertos in the classical era and the first four of Beethoven’s piano concertos, Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5 begins with an introductory orchestral chord a piano cadenza (a written cadenza, specifically) that is interrupted by the orchestra which plays a long chord before the piano cadenza continues. Immediately after the opening cadenzas, the orchestra follows with a broad, main exposition theme, with the dialogues between strings and winds. This theme embodies a typical Beethovenian style: bold, memorable, straightforward, yet rich with possibilities for expansion. It also brings a new spirit, reflecting Beethoven’s “heroic” period. Then, the piano repeats the same theme, and despite being the soloist, it also accompanies the orchestra. Subsequently, the development part is played with both the orchestra and the piano taking equal parts, with lots and lots of dialogue that makes this part even more complex. The recapitulation follows with no major changes, and when it comes to the cadenza preceding the coda part, Beethoven wrote, “Do not play a cadenza, but attack immediately the following”, meaning Beethoven did not give much freedom to the performers to improvise. The following coda concludes the first movement stunningly and majestically.

The second movement in the key of B major (surprisingly, as it is tonally far from E-flat major) opens with a slow-moving, sublime melody played by muted strings, picturing a theme of unparalleled beauty, tenderness, and depth. Following a small pause, the piano answers with the same theme in several variations. A brief contrast and drama interrupted the calmness of this movement before returning to the main theme with the orchestra playing the melody and the piano threading a delicate, shimmering accompaniment that surrounds the theme, evoking the soft glimmer of starlight. However, this movement does not end in the usual way, instead, the music settles on a low note, gently descends by a semitone, preceding the piano suggesting a new melody calmly, hinting at what lies ahead without revealing the remarkable character change in the final movement.

From quiet tranquility, Beethoven made the third movement burst into life with energetic rhythm, broad, joyful lines, and vibrant colors. The melody played at the end of the second movement becomes the main theme with powerful syncopated rhythms and bold phrases, interspersed with imaginative, playful episodes. Near the end, the music slows down while becoming calm, with only the duet of piano and timpani with pianissimo dynamic. Suddenly, the piano soars majestic scale passages preceding the flourishing orchestra, marking the grandious and massive ending of the whole piano concerto.
