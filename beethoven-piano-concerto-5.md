Beethoven is one of the most influential composers in classical music. Although Beethoven lived in classical era, especially when he was young, he did not follow any specific schools, guilds, or circles of composers that would influence his works, instead, he was courageous to explore and create music that was new and different.

Beethoven has set groundbreaking innovations in composing music. First, he broke the boundaries of classical era music that emphasizes clarity, lightness, and beauty, by composing darker, deeper, and sublime music. By doing this, he allowed his emotions and personal expressions to be in music. Second, he also explored new ways of playing music, such as making more virtuosic compositions that require more virtuosic and technical skill from performers. Third, he experimented with symphonic forms, leading him to compose his ninth symphony, the first-ever symphony not only performed by an orchestra but also by a choir. Therefore, it is not too much to say that Beethoven is the gate of romanticism, where he allowed later musicians to express their feelings in music and explore new harmonization and formation in composing music.

## Piano Concerto No. 5, Op. 73
Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 5, Op.73 is one of the most popular works that he ever composed. This piece is composed between 1809 and 1811, in his middle period, where he went beyond classicism and started to explore his individual style of writing music –including writing with bolder tone, larger range of notes, and longer length of music– which would lead him to the romanticism. 

When Beethoven started composing this piece, Europe was in the state of Napoleonic Wars. Beethoven was living in Vienna at that time, and in 1809, Napoleon's forces occupied the city, making it bombarded and many citizens, including Beethoven himself, suffered from the effects of the conflict. Although Beethoven once admired Napoleon as a symbol of freedom and republicanism, as he composed his piece with ideas of heroism, freedom, and leadership of Napoleon, later he despised Napoleon, even though the spirit still lived in his compositions.

Beethoven was also experiencing some of his significant struggles, such as his worsening deafness, making him exploring an introspective and complex compositional style with substantial emotional depth.

Although there are many groundbreaking compositional techniques in this piece, Beethoven still used some traditional techniques. For example, this piece consists of 3 movements, with the first movement using a sonata form. This structure was used by composers before Beethoven's time, such as Haydn in his [Piano Sonata in C Major, Hob.XVI:50](haydn-piano-sonata.md) and Mozart in his [Symphony No. 41](mozart-symphony.md). 

### I. Allegro
Unlike other concertos in the Classical period--and indeed, Beethoven's own previous concertos--Piano Concerto No. 5 opens with a striking innovation: a bold and broad orchestral chord introducing a written-out piano cadenza. The orchestra’s sustained chord interrupts the cadenza briefly, before the piano resumes, setting the tone for the dramatic, powerful journey to come. Following this unorthodox opening, the orchestra introduces a broad, main exposition theme, marked by stately dialogues between strings and winds. This theme embodies a typical Beethovenian style: bold, memorable, straightforward, yet rich with possibilities for expansion. It also brings a new spirit, reflecting Beethoven’s “heroic” period. The piano soon takes up the same theme, as both soloist and collaborator with the orchestra, blending the melody to showcase their unified dialogue. In the development section, the dialogue between piano and orchestra escalates, creating complex, engaging phrases that deepen the work's textural and harmonic complexity.. The recapitulation follows with no major changes, and when it comes to the cadenza preceding the coda part, Beethoven wrote, “Do not play a cadenza, but attack immediately the following”, to underscore his intention to maintain forward momentum, emphasizing the work's majesty rather than improvisational display. The first movement concludes with a stunning and sublime coda.

### II. Adagio un poco mosso
The second movement unfolds in the surprising key of B major, creating a peacful contrast to the heroic first movement. The muted strings introduce a slow, lyrical melody that evokes a profound sense of beauty, tenderness, and introspection. Following a small pause, the piano gently responds, offering variations on this theme that shimmer delicately, as if mirroring starlight. A brief contrast and drama interrupted the calm before returning to the main theme with the piano’s accompaniment surrounding the orchestra’s melody in soft, radiant tones. Unconventionally, this movement does not resolve in the usual manner; instead, it fades on a quiet note, with the piano descending by a half-step, subtly hinting at the spirited transformation in the final movement.

### III. Rondo: Allegro ma non troppo
From quiet tranquility, Beethoven made the third movement burst into life with energetic rhythm, broad, joyful lines, and vibrant colors. The melody played at the end of the second movement becomes the main theme with powerful syncopated rhythms and bold phrases, interspersed with imaginative, playful episodes. Near the end, the music slows down while becoming calm, with only the duet of piano and timpani with pianissimo dynamic. Suddenly, the piano soars majestic scale passages preceding the flourishing orchestra, marking the grandious and massive ending of the whole piano concerto.
