### Gustav Mahler was an Austrian composer and conductor from the Late Romantic period.
His family was poor, Mahler showed great musical talent as a child. At age 13, he studied piano and composition at the Vienna Conservatory.   

Before he became known as a composer, he was famous as an opera conductor, leading several opera teater.   

But for him, composing was always more important than conducting. Even during his summer vacation, he worked hard to finish his symphonies.

### His music often talks about love, pain, and death.
I think the sadness Mahler felt from losing his brothers, parents, and daughter, along with his fears about death and love because of his wife’s unfaithfulness, had a big impact on his music.

### I want to introduce Mahler's Symphony No. 1, one of his most famous pieces.

___

# Symphony no.1 D Major (Titan)
## 1st mov. [Langsam, Schleppend]
The first movement starts quietly and mysteriously. It gives a feeling that the world is gradually brightening and nature is awakening.   

The main melody also appears in his song 'Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen' and the lyrics show his love for nature.

## 2nd mov. [Kräftig bewegt, doch nicht zu schnell]

## 3rd mov. [Feierlich und gemessen, ohne zu schleppen]
In the third movement, Mahler arranged the French folk song Frère Jacques in a minor key as a funeral march.   

It gives a heavy and sorrowful feeling, with an intention to express death and loneliness.   

Using the double bass as a melodic instrument, something rare in earlier periods, reveals Mahler's experimental character.   



This is the main melody of 3rd movement.
