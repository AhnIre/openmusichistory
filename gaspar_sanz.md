## Why Gaspar Sanz?
Since I had played the classical guitar a lot, I still have interested in classical guitarists' works. However while studying musicology and history of western music, there are only few works including classical guitar. But classical guitar works have been developed anyway, and Gaspar Sanz is the most important guitartist who has contributed to development of classical guitar and Spanish classical music.
Gaspar Sanz is famous for his three pedagogical works. There are the original forms of modern guitar playing styles and scores, such as Raequeado, Punteado, Tablature and Nashvile chords. And still his works are still repeatedly-played repatoir for present classical guitar works.
