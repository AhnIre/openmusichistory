# Chopin
## Piano Sonata 
Chopin is my favorite composer because he is one of the composers who knows piano best and he is very lyrical.

Chopin's music is highly lyrical, and this tendency is particularly noticeable in his compositions of Nocturne, Ballad, and Improvisational music. The melody flows smoothly and naturally, and is characterized by deep emotional expression.
Chopin's jangsong is also characterized by regular rhythms that remind people of funeral parades. This rhythm emphasizes sadness and heartbreak, and the middle part of the third movement contrasts with bright and lyrical melodies, which are characterized by a soft and mellow atmosphere as if recalling a memory.
The song is also characterized by being used at Chopin's funeral.
