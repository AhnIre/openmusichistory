# Girolamo Frescobaldi (1583–1643)

Italian composer, 
I briefly studied Frescobaldi in a first-year university class. He is a lesser-known composer, but when I listened to his music, I found it incredibly captivating. What I found even more intriguing was the fact that the great composer Bach also studied and transcribed Frescobaldi's music. Since Frescobaldi contributed greatly to the development of keyboard music, I am eager to explore his life and works in more detail.
