# Robert Schumann
## Kreisleriana op.16
Schumann is the most lyrical and emotionally expressive composer among those of the Romantic era. Also, this work most clearly reflects Schumann's distinctive character.

The work by Schumann that I chose, *Kreisleriana*, is a piece composed based on a novel by Hoffmann.
So, who is Hoffmann?
## About Hoffmann
E.T.A. Hoffmann was a prominent novelist, composer, and critic representing German Romanticism in the early 19th century.
His works are known for their mysterious, fantastical themes and psychological depictions. 
Schumann was deeply fascinated by Hoffmann's literary world and incorporated it into his own musical compositions.

One of Schumann's major works, **Kreisleriana**, was inspired by the character Johannes Kreisler, who appears in Hoffmann's novels.
Kreisler is a strange yet brilliant musician, emotionally unstable and often caught up in unrealistic fantasies.
Schumann used this character to express his own dual personality and inner conflicts.
In his music, Schumann portrayed his two contrasting selves: the calm and reflective *Eusebius*, and the passionate and fiery *Florestan*.
