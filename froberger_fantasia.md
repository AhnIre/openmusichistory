This era saw the rise of expressive, dramatic musical forms and the development of new instrumental genres, particularly for keyboard instruments. Froberger lived and worked in a period shaped by the cultural exchanges among Italy, France, and Germany, and his travels throughout Europe deeply influenced his musical style.

**[Frescobaldi](frescobaldi_gagliarda.md) was his teacher**, and under his guidance in Rome, Froberger absorbed the improvisatory and expressive qualities of the Italian keyboard tradition.
