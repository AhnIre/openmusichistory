# Franz Joseph Haydn
## Piano Sonata Hob. XVI:50 1. Allegro
Haydn was born in Austria in 1732. He studied art almost by himself and music through the work of other composers. In particular, he is known to have been heavily influenced by C.P.E Bach, a leading composer from the classical period. Haydn established the framework for the piano sonata, which was later developed by Beethoven. Haydn's sonata was modeled after two basic sonata types. The first is the three-movement format of Allegro, Adagio, and Allegro, which was popular in North Germany, and the second is the three-movement structure centered on the Minuet seen in southern Vienna. Haydn's motif is short, instrumental, and simple, and even though two themes can be seen, they have monotopic characteristics that are similar in personality or form to each other. The next work to be introduced is Piano sonata Hob.xvi:50 Movement 1, which also clearly shows monotopic characteristics.
This song is that among the sonata's characteristics that require sophisticated expression of emotion and balance without being overly emotional, there are many couples who express optimistic and humorous characteristics of Haydn. Among the piano sonatas that can be a little serious, I thought it was the special charm of Haydn's sonata. In particular, there are many humorous and humorous expressions in the first movement of this song. I wanted to delve into the beauty of this song in detail, where there are many topics and conversations of responses.
