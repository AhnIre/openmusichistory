## Piano Sonata in F minor, BV 204
Dedicated to Anton Rubinstein (1829–1894), the Piano Sonata in F minor was written in 1883 and premiered in 1884, but it was not published until 1983. It consists of three movements:

I. Allegro risoluto vivace ed energico\
II. Andante con moto\
III. Nella guisa d'un'improvvisazione - Allegro fugato

This piece was directly influenced by Beethoven's piano sonatas, especially [Piano Sonata No. 21](beethoven-piano-sonata-no.21.md). (This is not true.)
