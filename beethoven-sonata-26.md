## Piano Sonata No. 26 "Das Lebewohl"


***Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 26, “Das Lebewohl”*** is a piece I studied and performed, playing the third movement in high school and the entire sonata in college. Initially, I was drawn to the piece because of the beautiful and impressive introduction in the first movement. As I learned more about the background of the work, I was able to understand the music on a deeper level, which I found very rewarding. I chose this piece because I believe understanding the emotions of farewell and reunion that Beethoven expresses enhances the listening experience.

***Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827)*** was a German composer and pianist, known as a pivotal figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras of music history. Born in Bonn, Beethoven inherited the traditions of Mozart and Haydn, advancing Classical forms while creating his own distinctive musical voice that paved the way for Romanticism. Initially influenced by Haydn and Mozart, Beethoven gradually established his own style with bold and intense expression. His works are known for their innovative forms and deep emotions, influencing both his contemporaries and subsequent generations of composers. Beethoven’s life was marked by the challenge of losing his hearing, a condition that became noticeable in his mid-30s. Remarkably, even as his hearing deteriorated, he composed some of his greatest works during this period. His compositions span many genres, including symphonies, piano sonatas, and string quartets. Notably, his Symphony No. 9 is hailed as a masterpiece that celebrates humanity and peace. He is remembered as a composer who used music to explore the human condition, express ideals of freedom, and engage with the social and political issues of his time.


### L.v.Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 26, "Das Lebewohl"
***Beethoven Piano Sonata No. 26*** was composed on April 9, 1808, when Napoleon's war between the French and Austria broke out and his sponsor, disciple, and friend, Grand Duke Rudolph, had to leave Vienna. It is well known as the subtitle "Daslebewohl", which is one of the few subtitles directly attached by Beethoven and the only one in the piano sonata genre. Beethoven, who had a close relationship with Grand Duke Rudolph, added a subtitle called "Das lebeweohl" to the first movement and recorded in the draft that "Around the departure of his beloved Grand Duke Rudolph in Vienna on May 4, 1809." The first introduction to the elan (Adagio) expresses the heaviness and sadness of the farewell, and the following part contains the conflict and tension of separation. The war ended on Oct. 14, 1809, and in January of the following year, the Grand Duke returned to Vienna. Movement 2 marked the period before the French withdrew due to the surrender of Austria and recorded "Die Abwesenheit." It contains the solitude and longing after the Grand Duke left, and the emotion of absence flows calmly with a quiet and contemplative atmosphere. Movement 3 recorded the joy of meeting the Grand Duke again with the subtitle "Das Wiederssehen," "The return of the beloved Grand Duke Rudolph, Jan. 30, 1810. It expresses the joy and joy of the Grand Duke's return, and expresses the emotion and joy that come from the reunion with a lively and cheerful rhythm. Completion was in early 1810 and dedicated to Grand Duke Rudolph. When Breitkoff and Hertel published the work, they changed the titles of each movement into French and marked "les adieux," "l'absence," and "le retour" on the cover of the score. However, Beethoven was very angry about this and protested it by writing, "Das lebeweohl is completely different from les adieux. The former is used only for loved ones from the heart, but the latter is for the entire audience."
