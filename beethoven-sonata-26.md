## Piano Sonata No. 26 "Das Lebewohl"
Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 26, “Das Lebewohl,” is a piece I studied and performed, playing the third movement in high school and the entire sonata in college. Initially, I was drawn to the piece because of the beautiful and impressive introduction in the first movement. As I learned more about the background of the work, I was able to understand the music on a deeper level, which I found very rewarding. I chose this piece because I believe understanding the emotions of farewell and reunion that Beethoven expresses enhances the listening experience.

Ludwig van Beethoven (1770-1827) was a German composer and pianist, known as a pivotal figure in the transition between the Classical and Romantic eras of music history. Born in Bonn, Beethoven inherited the traditions of Mozart and Haydn, advancing Classical forms while creating his own distinctive musical voice that paved the way for Romanticism. Initially influenced by Haydn and Mozart, Beethoven gradually established his own style with bold and intense expression. His works are known for their innovative forms and deep emotions, influencing both his contemporaries and subsequent generations of composers. Beethoven’s life was marked by the challenge of losing his hearing, a condition that became noticeable in his mid-30s. Remarkably, even as his hearing deteriorated, he composed some of his greatest works during this period. His compositions span many genres, including symphonies, piano sonatas, and string quartets. Notably, his Symphony No. 9 is hailed as a masterpiece that celebrates humanity and peace. He is remembered as a composer who used music to explore the human condition, express ideals of freedom, and engage with the social and political issues of his time.

This sonata was composed in 1809 when Napoleon’s French army invaded Austria, forcing Beethoven’s patron, pupil, and friend, Archduke Rudolf, to leave Vienna. Known by its subtitle “Les Adieux” (The Farewell), this is one of the few works where Beethoven himself gave the subtitle, and it is the only one among his piano sonatas to have a subtitle assigned by the composer. Beethoven, who had a close relationship with Archduke Rudolf, titled the first movement “Das Lebewohl” (The Farewell). In the original manuscript, he wrote: “Vienna, May 4, 1809, on the occasion of His Imperial Highness, Archduke Rudolf’s departure.” The war ended on October 14, 1809, and Rudolf returned to Vienna in January the following year. The second movement, “Die Abwesenheit” (The Absence), reflects the time of Rudolf’s absence during the war. The third movement, “Das Wiedersehen” (The Return), expresses the joy of reunion and was subtitled “The return of His Imperial Highness, Archduke Rudolf, January 30, 1810.” The piece was completed in early 1810 and dedicated to Archduke Rudolf. When the piece was first published by Breitkopf & Härtel, the titles of each movement were translated into French as “les adieux,” “l’absence,” and “le retour” on the cover of the score. Beethoven was angered by this, writing a letter of protest where he stated, “Das Lebewohl is entirely different from les adieux. The former is said from the heart to a loved one, while the latter is said to a crowd of people.”
