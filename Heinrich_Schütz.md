# Heinrich Schütz

Heinrich Schütz was a German composer, and Schütz played a very important role in the beginning of German Baroque music. He had a profound influence on later German music and is considered a figure who successfully integrated new Italian musical techniques into German music. Schütz was greatly influenced by contemporary Italian masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Monteverdi. He fused innovative Italian musical styles, including madrigal techniques and word painting, with the German Lutheran religious music tradition to build his own unique style. In particular, he is sometimes called the 'Father of German Music,' having inspired Johann Sebastian Bach.
