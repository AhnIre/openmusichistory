# Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsk (1859 - 1893)

Russian composer

He is a Russian composer and is considered the "greatest composer Russia has ever produced" and the "master of Russian classical music." His life as a musician, which he had always dreamed of but was not planned, has now left him immortal after various adversities and trials.

By adding the lyricism of Russian national music to the form and technology of Western music, works with colorful rhythms and oriental melodies were left.
