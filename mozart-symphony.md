## Symphony No. 41 "Jupiter"

Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756â€“1791) is one of the most important and influential composers in Western classical music history. 
His significance extends across various aspects of music, including innovation, technical mastery, emotional depth, and his lasting influence on future composers and musical traditions. 
Mozart opened new paths in various genres, including symphonies, concertos, operas, religious music, and chamber music. In particular, in opera, he brilliantly expressed psychological depth and human nature, setting a new standard for opera composition. Representative works include The Marriage of Figaro, Don Giovanni, and The Magic Flute.

Mozart's Symphony No. 41 in C major, K. 551, commonly known as the Jupiter Symphony, was his last symphony and was composed in 1788. 
The Jupiter Symphony raised classical formal beauty and balance to the highest level. Each movement is elaborately composed, and the melody and harmony are perfectly harmonized, making it an ideal model of a classical symphony. In particular, the fugue finale of the last movement is considered the pinnacle of classical symphonic composition.
Moreover, it goes beyond simple formal completion and expresses the multi-layered aspects of human emotions. From the energetic theme of the first movement to the lyrical and emotional melody of the second movement, the classical elegance of the third movement, and the majesty and grandeur of the fourth movement, it captures a wide range of emotions and leaves a strong impression on the listener.
This symphony later had a profound influence on Beethoven, Schubert, and others, serving as an important guide to composing symphonies during the Romantic era. In particular, Beethoven inherited the contrapuntal elements and structural grandeur of the Jupiter Symphony and reflected them in his own works.
