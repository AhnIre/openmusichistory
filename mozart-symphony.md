Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is one of the most important and influential composers in Western classical music history. 
His significance extends across various aspects of music, including innovation, technical mastery, emotional depth, and his lasting influence on future composers and musical traditions. 
Mozart opened new paths in various genres, including symphonies, concertos, operas, religious music, and chamber music.

### Mozart's Symphony No. 41 in C major, K. 551
Mozart's Symphony No. 41 in C major, K. 551, commonly known as the Jupiter Symphony, was his last symphony and was composed in 1788. 
The Jupiter Symphony raised classical formal beauty and balance to the highest level. Each movement is elaborately composed, and the melody and harmony are perfectly harmonized, making it an ideal model of a classical symphony. In particular, the fugue finale of the last movement is considered the pinnacle of classical symphonic composition.
Moreover, it goes beyond simple formal completion and expresses the multi-layered aspects of human emotions. From the energetic theme of the first movement to the lyrical and emotional melody of the second movement, the classical elegance of the third movement, and the majesty and grandeur of the fourth movement, it captures a wide range of emotions and leaves a strong impression on the listener.
This symphony later had a profound influence on Beethoven, Schubert, and others, serving as an important guide to composing symphonies during the Romantic era. In particular, Beethoven inherited the contrapuntal elements and structural grandeur of the Jupiter Symphony and reflected them in his own works.

## Description of each movement
#### 1. Allegro vivace
This opening movement is lively and energetic, filled with grand, sweeping melodies. Its themes convey both majesty and optimism, with a particularly rich orchestration that gives it a regal feel.

#### 2. Andante cantabile
In contrast to the first movement, the second is lyrical and gentle. It has a warm and contemplative quality, full of expressive melodies and a somewhat melancholic undertone, typical of Mozart's slow movements.

#### 3. Menuetto: Allegretto
This is a graceful minuet with an elegant rhythm. The dance-like nature gives it a light-hearted feel, though it's infused with enough complexity to maintain a sense of sophistication.

#### 4. Molto allegro
The final movement is the most famous part of the symphony, noted for its masterful use of counterpoint. Mozart introduces several themes that interweave in complex fugues, especially in the coda, where five themes are combined in a dazzling display of contrapuntal skill. This movement has an exhilarating, triumphant energy and is often considered one of Mozart's greatest achievements in orchestral music.
