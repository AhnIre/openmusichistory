Heinrich Schütz was a German composer, and Schütz played a very important role in the beginning of German Baroque music. He had a profound influence on later German music and is considered a figure who successfully integrated new Italian musical techniques into German music. Schütz was greatly influenced by contemporary Italian masters such as Giovanni Gabrieli and Monteverdi. He fused innovative Italian musical styles, including madrigal techniques and word painting, with the German Lutheran religious music tradition to build his own unique style. In particular, he is sometimes called the 'Father of German Music,' having inspired Johann Sebastian Bach. He went to Venice, Italy for study twice. During his second study trip in 1628, he encountered the music of [Claudio Monteverdi](monteverdi_lincoronazione_di_poppea.md), who was already leading the new trend in Italian music, and was deeply influenced. As a result, he succeeded in successfully fusuing the Italian style into German religious music.

## Why Heinrich Schütz?

When I was contemplating which composer to select, I became interested in Schütz upon seeing that most of his works are Protestant music. This is because, as a Christian myself, I became curious about how Schütz expressed 17th-century Protestant faith through his music. It is said that Schütz, a Lutheran, made significant contributions to the development of German Protestant music after the Reformation, particularly by composing oratorios, Passions, motets, and Bible stories based on German biblical texts.
