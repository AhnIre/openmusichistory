# Arnold Franz Walter Schönberg
## Pierro Lunaire
Arnold Schoenberg was an Austrian composer who had a profound influence on 20th-century modern music. He is renowned for pioneering atonality and developing the twelve-tone technique (dodecaphony), reaking away from traditional tonal music to explore new musical structures.
Arnold Schoenberg’s Pierrot Lunaire, Op. 21 is an Expressionist work composed in 1912, consisting of 21 songs. This piece holds a significant place in music history due to its use of atonality and the unique technique of Sprechstimme (speech-singing).
