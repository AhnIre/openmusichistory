## Pierro Lunaire


	•	Composer: Arnold Schoenberg
	•	Title: Pierrot Lunaire, Op. 21 is an Expressionist work composed in 1912, consisting of 21 songs. This piece holds a significant place in music history due to its use of atonality and the unique technique of Sprechstimme (speech-singing).
	•	Year of Composition: 1912
	•	Structure: Song cycle based on 21 poems
	•	Original Poet: Albert Giraud

This piece has several notable features.

	1.	Atonality: Typically, music classified as “classical” or “popular” is tonal, meaning it adheres to a key center where tonic and dominant relationships are emphasized. However, Schoenberg avoided being confined to a specific key. Pierrot Lunaire is an example of this approach. While it progresses without traditional harmonic structures, it still conveys a strong sense of musicality.

	2.	Sprechstimme: Similar to recitative but distinct, this is a unique technique that is neither fully singing nor plain speech. It involves delivering the text in a speech-like manner while maintaining the pitch of each note.
