> The study of the friendship or personal relationship between [Gustav Mahler](https://github.com/hskye79/openmusichistory/blob/main/mahler-symphony.md) (1860-1911) and Arnold Schoenberg (1874-1951) initially began through primary sources such as the memoirs and letters of Mahler‚Äôs wife, Alma (1879-1964), as well as Schoenberg‚Äôs lectures. Since then, musicologists have focused on the friendship or musical influence between these composers. Through these documents, we learn that Schoenberg was initially not very friendly toward Mahler, but gradually came to respect him personally after their first meeting. Furthermore, it is evident that Mahler supported his younger colleague Schoenberg in various ways.

## Several notable features

Comments: It would be better to show this interesting features with the score and add what parts it is.

	1. Atonality : Typically, music classified as ‚Äúclassical‚Äù or ‚Äúpopular‚Äù is tonal, meaning it adheres to 
 	a key center that emphasizes tonic and dominant relationships. However, Schoenberg avoided being confined
  	to a specific key. Pierrot Lunaire exemplifies this approach. While it progresses without traditional
   	harmonic structures, it still conveys a strong sense of musicality. 

	2. Sprechstimme: Similar to recitative but distinct, Sprechstimme is a unique technique that lies
 	between singing and plain speech. It involves delivering the text in a speech-like manner while maintaining
  	the pitch of each note.

His works explore new musical concepts, including ‚Äúatonality‚Äù and the ‚Äútwelve-tone technique.‚Äù Compared to Debussy, he is a pioneer of Expressionism and avant-garde music, an approach that later influenced Berg‚Äôs serialism.
