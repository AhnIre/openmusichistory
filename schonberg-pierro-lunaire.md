### This piece has several notable features.

	1.	Atonality: Typically, music classified as “classical” or “popular” is tonal, meaning it adheres to a key center where tonic and dominant relationships are emphasized. However, Schoenberg avoided being confined to a specific key. Pierrot Lunaire is an example of this approach. While it progresses without traditional harmonic structures, it still conveys a strong sense of musicality.

	2.	Sprechstimme: Similar to recitative but distinct, this is a unique technique that is neither fully singing nor plain speech. It involves delivering the text in a speech-like manner while maintaining the pitch of each note.

## Pierro Lunaire & Schoenberg's importance
 He is an influential figure in 20th-century modern music, often referred to as the Second Viennese School. As seen in his works, he explored new music through concepts such as “atonality” and the “twelve-tone technique.” Compared to Debussy, he is a pioneer of Expressionism and avant-garde music. This approach later influenced Berg’s serialism.
