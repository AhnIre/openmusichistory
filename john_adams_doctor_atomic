# "Batter my heart"
"Batter my heart" is a poignant aria from John Adams' opera Doctor Atomic, performed by the character of J. Robert Oppenheimer. The text is adapted from a metaphysical sonnet by John Donne, which portrays a deeply personal plea to God for spiritual renewal through forceful intervention.
In the opera, the aria occurs at a climactic moment, reflecting Oppenheimer's internal conflict as he grapples with the moral implications of his role in creating the atomic bomb. The aria’s intense, introspective nature mirrors his anguish and sense of responsibility for unleashing a power capable of unprecedented destruction.
